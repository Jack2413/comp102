=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

No, but i did finish the exercise as usualï¼Œ and I find out the exercise is quite helpful.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

when add the shape to the front of the arraylist it is not working.and some shape will disappear.the problem is when i using shapes.add(0, shapes.get(i)) then shapes.remove(i); i did remove the shape that in-front of the expected shape. I did fixed the problem by add 1 shapes.remove(i+1).to fix next time need to remember to add one. 

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
