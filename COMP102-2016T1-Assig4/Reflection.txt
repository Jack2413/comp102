Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

No,because i don’t have time to do it. I spend my time to for doing the exercise.
and the exercise is quite helpful.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

The error,bug I find out this week is: when I use the while loop1 inside the while loop2,
the things i did change inside the while loop1 (double,Int) will reflect while loop2. So，when I want to while while loop 1, i should restore the variables，and add ++；to the double of the loop. I think the easier way to fix next time is to remember this times error, avoid mistakes and label each doubles before get in to loops.
 
3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

The tricolour Flag drawer is similar to previous one, it is easier this time because I used while loop to draw, rather then use a lot of similar codes.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

For use drawOvel method I have better understanding，before I was confuse about the starting position（left，top）. It lead to i drew some strange image. Unit I drew
the ConcentricBoard, I understand the (left,top,size,size) ,what those variable for, and
how does the dwarves method works.
