Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

No, but i did finish the exercise as usual， and I find out the exercise is quite helpful
for my assignments.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

ArrayIndex Out of bounds exception, the values is out of range, by fixed the problem is make sure that the values are inside the range.to fixing the bug I use -1 in the for loops. And I think the easier way to fix next time is Calculate the values first or draw a 
2d array on paper to see what happen, then write the for loops.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

Use for loops and array list, is similar to last 2 assignments, it was easier this time because i got a good understand how does the army list work.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
I thing this time the challenge question is quite hard，when i store the changed image in my temp how do i know which pixel is my starting point. and how do i fill the pixels between the original pixel and the extended pixel. This troubled me for few days, but after i did it, is not that hard as what I thought.
