Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

No, but i did finish the exercise as usual， and I find out the exercise is quite helpful
for my assignments.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

lots of error, bugs i find out this week. for example in mini paint the pen tools when I drew the line it always start at the top left conner because i didn’t set a variable that link to dragx dragy， so each time i drew it，it always start on 0，0.After I fixed by set pressx = dragx， pressy =dragy before it get in to pen loops, and it works。

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

the drawing shapes, use loops, calling methods，and return methods.basically every thing is similar, the only difference is the  new stuff we learn add to this assignment. I finish later this time,I think because the work is lot more then last time.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

I very enjoy the assignment this time,  i think because this is a game assignment (making games), I hope i can have more the smilier assignment like this, it is pain and fun : ).
