Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

No,because i don’t have time to do it.But I spend my time to for doing the exercise.
and I find out the exercise is quite helpful
.
2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

the error bug i find out this time is the pixels(little dot i draw) are in the wrong position. that makes the image look strange, the dot are in the position that it should,t be. After i find out the mistakes are I put the rows and vertical wrong way round, I should put the column while loop inside the row while loop. I think the best way to making it easier to fix next time is to remember the mistakes this time, when drawing images use the rows while loop first.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

yes,in this time assignment I used a lot while loop method there are similar to assignment 4, and the imageRenderer is similar to the patterns drawer, and i did use the similar method to draw the images. I think the assignment is hard this time, but i used the same amount of time to finish it, so i think this time skilled than last time to doing the similar thing。

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
